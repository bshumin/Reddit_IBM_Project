# Reddit_IBM_Project
Using IBM Watson Natural Language Processing API along with Python to create a program that can process data points. The resulting returned data points should contain keywords, sentiment score and emotion score from Watson's NLP.

# Basic Description of the Project and Workflow
The project's main goal was to clean data from a set of 2.1 million comments and return the desired results from Waston NLP. The project was largely worked on using Git and GitHub for version control and much of the foundational code was already written when I came onto the project.

# WorkLoad
The main issues with the code at the time were an incorrectly formatted output file (.csv) and general bugs that caused the program to error out after processing over 100 data points. I had to read through all of the created programs and find the issues that lead to errors in the output file and fix bugs with the code. I also ended up adding error logging and error handling to most of the code to troubleshoot the issues being experienced as well as.
